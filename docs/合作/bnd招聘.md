## 🔥 Team Looking for Members | LiqPass / 1USD Accelerator (BNB Build in Public 2026)

### Team name

**LiqPass / 1USD Accelerator**

### What we’re building

We’re building **LiqPass**, a Web3 project with two core modules:

**1) 1USD Accelerator**
A **$1 prediction market** that turns real user attention into:

* price signals (price = opinion)
* trend discovery
* early project validation + exposure

It’s designed as a **public pre-market** before hackathons, competitions, or funding rounds.

**2) LiqPass (Insurance Module)**
A **parametric short-term insurance** product for leveraged traders:

* 8h / 24h / monthly coverage
* users lock in max downside *before* opening a position
* liquidation tail risk → predictable upfront cost

👉 The insurance module is a **sub-project that received official funding from Optimism (OP) Season 8**.

### Current status

* Core mechanism & product design completed
* Smart contracts + backend logic implemented
